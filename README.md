# prolin

Prolin is a linear programming library for Clojure. It provides
idiomatic Clojure APIs to formulate and solve linear programming
problems, and a small set of utilties for some common transformations
of LP objective functions and constraints.

It uses the Simplex algorithm provided by Apache Commons Math
internally as its core LP solver.
